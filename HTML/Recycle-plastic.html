        <h3 class = "head2">In order for your plastic water bottle to get from your recycling bin and made into new products, it goes on a long journey!</h3>
        <h3 class="head2">Steps are shown below</h3>
        <p>1)First, your bottle must be collected by a recycling facility. This can happen when recycling collection drivers pick up your plastic recycling bin on your curb in front of your house, or when you bring your recyclable waste to a local recycling facility.</p>
        <p>2)Next, if your local recycling company has implemented a Single Stream Recycling System, by which all materials are collected together, these materials must undergo a sorting process to separate different materials, such as glass, paper, or metals. Most often, the majority of this sorting process is done automatically by machines, but it may also include one manual sort to eliminate as much contamination of the materials as possible.</p>
        <p>3)Since there are numerous types of plastics in use today, all of the plastic materials in a recycling facility must be separated by type. Your plastic water bottle will likely be grouped with the other plastic materials made with #1 polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) plastic.Unfortunately, certain types of plastics are not as easily recycled as other types of plastics. Many recycling facilities do not have equipment that can handle every type of plastic, and so these items may be sold to another facility that can recycle them or they may end up in a landfill. Ask your plastic recycling company about what they do with items they cannot process.</p>
        <p>4)Next, your plastic water bottle will go to an area of the recycling facility where it will be ground up into chips or flakes, and the plastic will then be washed to get rid of any labels or remaining residue.</p>
        <p>5)The plastic is dried, melted, and formed into pellets, which can be used for manufacturing new products.</p>
        <p>6)Recycled plastic pellets can then be sold to companies and used to make different products. Some products made from recycled plastic bottles include artificial fleece, engineered wood products, carpeting, floor mats, tiles, furniture, motor oil, detergent bottles, pipes and pails.</p>
        <h3 class="head2">Your water bottle will now be given a new life as something else! Plastic bottle recycling is then definitely worth your effort.

            <h3 class = "head2">Most plastic bags are made from high-density polyethylene (#2 plastic), but the thinner-material bags (such as produce bags) are made from low-density polyethylene (#4 plastic). The recycling collection system is widely available, mostly through collection bins at grocery stores.</h3>
            <h3 class="head2">Plastic Bag Recycling Preparation</h3>
            <p>1)Remove anything inside the bags, such as receipts, stickers, or crumbs. All these items will contaminate your bag load.</p>
            <p>2)Keep a bag collection bin in your house, such as one big garbage bag for all bags. Since they compact easily, you should be able to fit 50 to 100 plastic bags in one garbage bag.</p>
            <p>3)Make sure any bags you are recycling have a #2 or #4 plastic symbol on them. If not, you can’t be sure what plastic resin the bag is made from, so you’ll want to reuse it instead, before eventually throwing it away.</p>
            <h3 class="head2">Plastic Bag Recycling Process</h3>
            <p>Plastic bag recycling involves chipping the bags into pellets. While pellets can then be reprocessed into new bags, they will most likely be shipped to a company like Trex to be manufactured into plastic lumber.</p>

            <h2 class="head">Recycling for Plastic lids and caps</h2>
            <h3 class = "head2">Much of the confusion with caps stems from the fact that they are made of a different plastic resin than the bottle or jug they secure. Most caps are made of polypropylene (#5 plastic), with some (like sports drink bottles) composed of high-density polyethylene (#2 plastic). Plastic bottles and jugs are typically #1 or #2 plastic.</h3>
            <h3 class="head2">Plastic lid and cap Recycling Preparation</h3>
            <p>1)For plastic bottles, you need to ask your local recycling program whether caps are accepted before trying to recycle them with the bottle. Some will ask you to leave them on, some accept caps but want them separated, and some will ask you to throw them away.</p>
            <p>2)For plastic containers (e.g. butter tubs, yogurt cartons), the lid is usually made of the same material as the base. If the container is #5 plastic, odds are strong that the lid is as well. In these cases, feel free to reattach the lid before recycling if your program accepts non-bottle plastics.</p>
            <h3 class="head2">Plastic lid and caps Recycling Process</h3>
            <p>Assuming you left the cap on the bottle, the first step in the recycling process is to separate the bottles and caps into their individual resins. The material recovery facility (MRF) will use a pressurized system to expel caps and flatten bottles. Plastics are then soaked in water, where the bottle (made of #1 plastic) will sink and the cap (#2 or #5 plastic) will float.</p>
            <p>Recyclers will shred the #2 or #5 plastic into flakes, which are washed, rinsed and dried. Flakes are then melted into pellets, which are transported to a manufacturer to make new plastic caps or other materials, such as casing for car batteries, storage containers or reusable plastic bags.</p>
